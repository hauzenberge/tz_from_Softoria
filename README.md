## Data Handling Architecture

In this project, form data is directed to the from_data table for simplified data processing. This architectural decision is made to streamline data management and enhance the application's maintainability and scalability. By segregating form data into its dedicated table, we ensure clear separation of concerns and facilitate efficient data handling operations.

## Logic behind php artisan response:start

The php artisan response:start command orchestrates data processing logic, specifically designed to handle interactions with external services. Although the logic encapsulated in this command could potentially be moved to queues or caching mechanisms for improved performance, it's deliberately implemented as a direct process to illustrate the fundamental workflow of interacting with external services. This approach provides clarity and transparency regarding the application's interaction with external systems, aiding in troubleshooting and future enhancements.
